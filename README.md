This project was organized during my second semester in my first year at university. I really like Japanese comics such as animes and mangas so I decided to choose this topic for my Web Development class !

## General info
MangaMe is a manga reading website inspired by many other similar web pages such as Nettruyen, Truyenqq,...It provides everything a manga geeks need from reading latest mangas, finding information about the manga itself, logging in and registering as a new member for the website. It also gives admins *CRUD* ability to create, read, update, edit or delete any manga, chapter and image. Admins can also add a new admin if they want. Nevertheless, because of the scale of the project and my limited time to do other class activities at school so the bookmark and rating system have not been fully implemented. Still, this project can be considered as completed under the requirements of my mentor. To fetch all the images of a manga chapter, I used the simple_html_dom library, which is a simple web scraper using PHP. I used it to collect the mangas that I want from other websites and then save them to my MySQL database. In reality, many websites have been using this trick to get contents from other websites and this can be considered as illegal under The Creative Commons copyright licenses or some other licenses. However, this website is created for educational purpose and was apparently not public. I deployed this website to my private web hosting belonging to my university as a way to showcase what I have learnt to my mentor. Having completed this project, I felt satisfied and happy that I can make a website to help me and possibly many other '*Wibu*' to read their favorite mangas !
